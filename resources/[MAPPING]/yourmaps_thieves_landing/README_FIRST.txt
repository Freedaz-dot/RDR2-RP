RemoveImap(-688011628) --- [0xD6FDC694] = {hashname="",dec_hash=-688011628,x=-1395.375366211,y=-2316.3881835938,z=43.84504699707,h=8.173550605774},

VERY IMPORTANT:
This is not a final work. More updates can come as more tools will be available. Just enjoy RolePlay with this buildings in your server!

As tools for RedM are still in development and the amount of streaming MLO is still an issue with crashes, we made this building without portals, meaning that won't rain inside but the weather like wind/blizzards may affect inside, as snow on floor.
As soon we have more news about streaming development we will adapt and update for free this MLO for you!

Thank you
